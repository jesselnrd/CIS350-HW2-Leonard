Technical Background:
I started my college career as an engineering student at Grand Valley State University. After my third semester I decided that I was more interested in computer programming that I was with applications such as CAD and CAM. I am now a Junior at GVSU with a major in computer science. I am sufficient in C, Java, and Python coding languages. I worked at Grand Valley State University's Campus Dining HR department for my first and second year of my university education. During which time I was put in charge of several spreadsheet templates used to track data of Campus Dining student employees' employment information. I have also built/assisted the building process of 6 gaming PC's, and 2 of which I was the sole builder.
